Tetra is released under the terms of the MIT license. See `COPYING` for more

Development process
-------------------

Developers work in their own trees, then submit pull requests when they think
their feature or bug fix is ready.

If it is a simple/trivial/non-controversial change, then one of the Tetra
development team members simply pulls it.

If it is a *more complicated or potentially controversial* change, then the patch
submitter will be asked to start a discussion with the devs and community.

The `master` branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be
completely stable.
